We have created Tic Tac Toe game:
4 classes
Main class: the main code
Board class: appearance of the game is described and all methods that interact with it
Rules class: all rules and output of the winner
SQL class: where we send and get the data with DBMS
When the application ran user has 3 choices:
To start the game; To see stats; Exit from the application

This is our SQL code
